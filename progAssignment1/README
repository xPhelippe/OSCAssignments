the purpose of this file was to work with 

1) taking in values from the CLI using C
2) work with creating and waiting for child processes
3) sending data between parent and child processes

below is a description of all C files

6138.c: the main file. This was meant to create 1-3 children based on input, add an array by dividing it among the children and then returning the sum to the parent.

argsPractice.c: a simple program to practice taking in arguments the user inputs in the CLI

printfPractice.c: this program was used to help debug an issue I had with processes printing out the same statement multiple times. I learned that I needed to flush stdout in order to solve the issue.
